# Overview
AWS Shield Advanced One Click deployments allows customers getting started with Shield Advanced to get an out of the box recommended baseline configuration.  You execute a single Python script and 16 required input parameters with 39 optional parameters to scope and otherwise tune this deployment.  This template creates:  

## Core Deployment

### Central Common resources  
A core deployment creates a central S3 bucket for all WAFv2 logs as well as an Athena Table with useful named queries and views, and some additional supporting resources.  

## Organizational Deployment
### Subscribe and Configure Shield Advanced  
Subscribes account to Shield via a custom lambda backed resource.  Configures Sheild Response Team (SRT) access and proactive engagement

### Firewall Manager Security Policies for Shield Protection  
Creates Security policies in each configured region and globally (if desired) to ensure resources are shield protected based on a provided scope

### Firewall Manager Security Policies for WAFv2  
Creates Security policies in each configured region and globally (if desired) to manage WAFv2 on supported resources based on a provided scope


# Prerequisites

##  AWS Support  
Business or Enterprise Support must be enabled on any account where SRT access and/or Proactive Engagment will be enabled

## AWS Organizations
This will only apply to accounts that are members of your designated AWS Organization. The Python script queries your Organization Management account to identify all the member Organizational Units and Accounts
Recommended to delegate administration to another account such as your default Firewall Manager administrator account. (see below)

## AWS Firewall Manager
Firewall Manager must be enabled. Recommended to delegate administration to another account
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/enable-integration.html

## AWS Config
AWS Config must be enabled with at least the following resources enabled:  
```
AWS::ApiGateway::Stage,
AWS::CloudFront::Distribution,
AWS::EC2::EIP,
AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer,
AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer,
AWS::Shield::Protection,
AWS::WAF::WebACL,
AWS::WAFv2::WebACL,
AWS::ShieldRegional::Protection
```

# Deployment configuration
## Default
If you only provide answers for mandatory fields, the default deployment will do the following:

1. Subscribe and configure Shield Advanced for all AWS accounts within the AWS Organization.  
2. Shield protect all supported regional resources as well as CloudFront distributions.  
3. All CloudFront Distributions, Application Load balancers, and API Gateways will have an AWS WAF WebACL attached (if there was not already one in place).  
4. All WebACLs send WAF logs to a central bucket in a central region. _This S3 bucket is created in the location the initial stack was deployed in._
5.  The WebACl includes the following rules:  
a) A [Rate based rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-rate-based.html) with a value of 10,000 action of Count  
b) [Anonymous IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-ip-rep.html#aws-managed-rule-groups-ip-rep-anonymous) Amazon Managed rule | All rule actions overridden to Count  
c) [IP Reputation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-ip-rep.html#aws-managed-rule-groups-ip-rep-amazon) Amazon Managed rule | All rules with action Block  
d) [Core Rule Set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline.html#aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline-crs) Amazon Managed rule | All rule actions overridden to Count  
e) [Known Bad Inputs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline.html#aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline-known-bad-inputs) Amazon Managed rule | All rule actions overridden to Count  
6.  An Athena Table and workgroup created with several named queries and views relevant to reviewing WAF logs.

## **Customization**

Terraform variables allow you to change the default behavior as follows:

### **Scope**
1. You can configure which region(s) are in scope.  This applies to subscribing and configuring Shield as well as Firewall Manager security policies.
2. You can configure which AWS accounts are in scope.  This applies to subscribing and configuring Shield as well as Firewall Manager security policies.
3. Firewall Manager security policies can be scoped to only certain resource types and/or the presence of specific tags on resources.
4. Firewall Manager security policies can be scoped based on the specific tag name/values or existance of specific tag names.  Shield and WAFv2 policies can specify different tag scopes.

### **Configuration**
**Shield**  
1. SRT access can be enabled/disable.
2. SRT can be given access to S3 Buckets.
3. The IAM role used to grant SRT Access (if enabled).
4. Choose to have CloudFormation create the SRT Access role or specify the name of a role that already exists.

**AWS WAF**
1. The rate based rule value and action can be changed between 100 and 2,000,000 and set to "Block".
2. Each Amazon Managed Rule (AMR) can set the action for that AMR to "Count" or "Block".


# How to deploy

The python script tfstacks.py executes both the core-deployment and organizational-deployment Terraform configurations. 
You will need 2 separate tfvars files to be referenced during the script execution. See below for example execution of the python script. (It is advised to run this inside a python virtual environment). The `core-var-file` and the `org-var-file` tfvars are relative to the `core-deployment` and `organizational-deployment` directories respectively.

```
python3 tfstacks.py --core-var-file example.tfvars --org-var-file example.tfvars
```

The following sections require your acknowledgment (Set to _true_) or have a mandatory input that require your attention.

# Required Terraform Configuration 

In order to properly configure Terraform for your environment the backend configuration *MUST* be customized to your environment. In the `core-deployment` and `organizational-deployment` directories in the `terraform` block within `main.tf` you *MUST* enter the appropriate values for your backend s3 configuration (or leverage another backend). 

*NOTE:* The execution of this relies on workspaces to control the deployments to the individual accounts.
```
backend "s3" {
    // Backend state MUST be properly confgured and is specific to deployment environment.
    bucket = "<BACKEND_STATE_BUCKET>"
    workspace_key_prefix = "<WORKSPACE_KEY_PREFIX>"
    key = "<BACKEND_STATE_FILE_KEY>"
    region = "<BACKEND_REGION>"
  }
```

# Variables
Variables are divided into logical groups of parameters between mandatory and optional parameters.  Mandatory parameters either require the end user to input/select a value, or explicity verify something.  Optional parameters allow end users to customize (e.g. WAF rule actions ) or configure optional features (e.g more than one proactive engagement emergency contact)

--- 

## Core Deployment
The core-deployment has only 2 variables that must be set to be available to set up.

- `scope_regions`: This will determine which regions will be affected. The python script utilizes this variable in addition to Terraform to determine which regions in the Organization Accounts will be targeted.
- `use_lake_formation_permisisons`: This determines if lake formation permissions are used when creating the Athena
```
scope_regions = ["<region1>", "<region2>", ..., "regionN"]
use_lake_formation_permissions = true | false
```
- `region`: This is the target region for the primary deployment in which the aws provider is anchored.
