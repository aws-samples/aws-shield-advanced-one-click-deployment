# AWS Shield Advanced One Click  - CloudFormation
# Overview
AWS Shield Advanced One Click deployments allows customers getting started with Shield Advanced to get an out of the box recommended baseline configuration.  You deploy a single CloudFormation Template and 16 required input parameters with 40 optional parameters to scope and otherwise tune this deployment.  This template creates:  

## Nested Stack

### Central Common resources  
A nested stack creates a central S3 bucket for all WAFv2 logs as well as an Athena Table with useful named queries and views.  

## StackSet
### Subscribe and Configure Shield Advanced  
Subscribes account to Shield via a custom lambda backed resource.  Configures Shield Response Team (SRT) access and proactive engagement

### Firewall Manager Security Policies for Shield Protection  
Creates Security policies in each configured region and globally (if desired) to ensure resources are shield protected based on a provided scope

### Firewall Manager Security Policies for WAFv2  
Creates Security policies in each configured region and globally (if desired) to manage WAFv2 on supported resources based on a provided scope

# How To Video
This [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCA3FwMk_QE) video goes into detail about how this solution works and what it achieves.
# Prerequisites

##  AWS Support  
Business or Enterprise Support must be enabled on any account where SRT access and/or Proactive Engagement will be enabled

## AWS Organizations
CloudFormation Service Managed StackSets must be enabled.  Recommended to delegate administration to another account (example video is going to delegate it to the FMS Admin account)
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html

## AWS Firewall Manager
Firewall Manager must be enabled. Recommended to delegate administration to another account
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/enable-integration.html

## AWS Config
AWS Config must be enabled with at least the following resources enabled:
```
AWS::ApiGateway::Stage,
AWS::CloudFront::Distribution,
AWS::EC2::EIP,
AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer,
AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer,
AWS::Shield::Protection,
AWS::WAF::WebACL,
AWS::WAFv2::WebACL,
AWS::ShieldRegional::Protection
```
### Recommended deployment
Use the StackSet Sample Template called [Enable AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-sampletemplates.html) with the following parameters:

1. AllSupported: False

2. ResourceTypes: 
    ```
    AWS::ApiGateway::Stage,

    AWS::Shield::Protection,
    AWS::WAF::WebACL,
    AWS::WAFv2::WebACL,
    AWS::ShieldRegional::Protection
    ```

# Setup
Run the below from the root directory of the cloned code.This will create a S3 bucket, transform template.yaml and copy the code into that S3 bucket.


Configure AWS Credentials if needed. If you want to deploy to a region other than us-east-1, ensure you configure region to that value.
```
aws configure
```
Get Account and region from credentials.  Create s3 bucket named code-oneclickshield-\<AccountId\>-\<region\> e.g. code-oneclickshield-111111111111-us-east-1

```
export AccountId=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text)
export rootId=$(aws organizations list-roots --query Roots[0]."Id" | tr -d '"')
export rootArn=$(aws organizations list-roots --query Roots[0].Arn)
export delegatedServices=$(aws organizations list-delegated-services-for-account --account-id $AccountId --query DelegatedServices)
export FMSAdminValue=$(aws fms get-admin-account --query AdminAccount | tr -d '"')
if [[ $AccountId == $FMSAdminValue ]]; then
    $FMSAdminValue = "SELF"
fi
if [[ $rootArn == *"$AccountId"* ]]; then
    export callAs="SELF"

elif [[ $delegatedServices == *"member.org.stacksets.cloudformation.amazonaws.com"* ]]; then
    export callAs="DELEGATED_ADMIN"
else
    echo "Current account: AccountId is not a Delegated Administrator for CloudFormation Service Managed StackSets"
fi

export region=$(aws configure get region)
if [ -z "$region" ]; then
    export region='us-east-1'
fi

echo "AccountId: $AccountId"
echo "Region: $region"
echo "rootId: $rootId"
echo "RootArn: $rootArn"
echo "CallAs: $callAs"

#Update this to match your bucket name if you prefer to set some other S3 bucket name schema
export BucketName=code-oneclickshield-$AccountId-$region

if [[ $region = "us-east-1" ]]; then
    aws s3api create-bucket --bucket "$BucketName" --region $region
else
    aws s3api create-bucket --bucket "$BucketName" --region $region --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint="$region"  
fi

aws s3 sync ./templates/ s3://$BucketName --include "./*.yaml" --exclude ".git/*"

echo -e "\033[0;32mOpen this link to start deploying the CloudFormation Template: \033[0;34m\nhttps://$region.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=$region#/stacks/quickcreate?templateURL=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.$region.amazonaws.com%2F$BucketName%2Ftemplate.yaml&stackName=aws-shield-advanced-one-click-deploy&param_IncludeGlobalResourceTypes=false&param_ResourceTypes=%3CAll%3E&param_NotificationEmail=%3CNone%3E&param_TopicArn=%3CNew%20Topic%3E&param_DeliveryChannelName=%3CGenerated%3E&param_PrimaryRegion=&param_S3KeyPrefix=%3CNo%20Prefix%3E&param_Frequency=24hours&param_SNS=true&param_AllSupported=true&param_S3BucketName=%3CGenerated%3E&param_ScopeDetails=$rootId&param_RootId=$rootId&param_CallAs=$callAs&param_ScopeRegions=$region&param_FMSAdministratorAccount=$FMSAdminValue"


```

# Deployment configuration
## Default
If you only provide answers for mandatory fields, the default deployment will do the following:

1. Subscribe and configure Shield Advanced for all AWS accounts within the AWS Organization.  
2. Shield protect all supported regional resources as well as CloudFront distributions.  
3. All CloudFront Distributions, Application Load balancers, and API Gateways will have an AWS WAF WebACL attached (if there was not already one in place).  
4. All WebACLs send WAF logs to a central bucket in a central region. _This S3 bucket is created in the location the initial stack was deployed in._
5.  The WebACl includes the following rules:  
a) A [Rate based rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-rate-based.html) with a value of 10,000 action of COUNT  
b) [Anonymous IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-ip-rep.html#aws-managed-rule-groups-ip-rep-anonymous) Amazon Managed rule | All rule actions overridden to COUNT  
c) [IP Reputation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-ip-rep.html#aws-managed-rule-groups-ip-rep-amazon) Amazon Managed rule | All rules with action BLOCK  
d) [Core Rule Set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline.html#aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline-crs) Amazon Managed rule | All rule actions overridden to COUNT  
e) [Known Bad Inputs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline.html#aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline-known-bad-inputs) Amazon Managed rule | All rule actions overridden to COUNT    
6. All Shield Protected resources that support AWS WAF (CloudFront and Application Load Balancers) configured with Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation enabled and an action of COUNT
7.  An Athena Table and workgroup created with several named queries and views relevant to reviewing WAF logs.

## **Customization**

CloudFormation parameters allow you to change the default behavior as follows:

### **Scope**
1. You can configure which region(s) are in scope.  This applies to subscribing and configuring Shield as well as Firewall Manager security policies.
2. You can configure which AWS accounts are in scope.  This applies to subscribing and configuring Shield as well as Firewall Manager security policies.
3. Firewall Manager security policies can be scoped to only certain resource types and/or the presence of specific tags on resources.
4. Firewall Manager security policies can be scoped based on the specific tag name/values or existence of specific tag names.  Shield and WAFv2 policies can specify different tag scopes.

### **Configuration**
**Shield**  
1. SRT access can be enabled/disable.
2. SRT can be given access to S3 Buckets.
3. The IAM role used to grant SRT Access (if enabled).
4. Choose to have CloudFormation create the SRT Access role or specify the name of a role that already exists.

**AWS WAF**
1. The rate based rule value and action can be changed between 100 and 2,000,000 and set to "Block".
2. Each Amazon Managed Rule (AMR) can set the action for that AMR to "Count" or "Block".
